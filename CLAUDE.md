# Claude Development Guide - Powered by Donation

## Project Overview

**Powered by Donation** is a donation-service marketplace where service providers offer skills in exchange for charitable donations. Service seekers browse services and make donations to JustGiving charities. We facilitate connections but don't handle payments directly.

### Market Position & Similar Platforms

**Powered by Donation** operates in the established "charity-driven free services" market alongside several similar platforms:

#### Similar Platforms:
- **Catchafire**: Professionals provide free services to nonprofits
- **Taproot Foundation**: Skilled volunteers offer free professional services to nonprofits  
- **Vollie**: Free online professional services for charities and social enterprises

#### Platform Comparison:

| Feature | Powered by Donation | Catchafire | Taproot Foundation | Vollie |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Service Recipients** | General consumers | Nonprofits only | Nonprofits only | Nonprofits/Social enterprises |
| **Payment to Providers** | None (free services) | None (volunteering) | None (volunteering) | None (volunteering) |
| **Charitable Impact** | Donors choose any charity | Benefits served nonprofit | Benefits served nonprofit | Benefits served nonprofit |
| **Service Scope** | Any professional service | Nonprofit-focused needs | Business/strategy focus | Online skills-based |
| **Geographic Focus** | Global (17 languages) | Global | US-focused | Australia-focused |
| **Donation Structure** | Fixed amounts to chosen charity | Direct nonprofit benefit | Direct nonprofit benefit | Direct nonprofit benefit |
| **Target Market** | Consumer-facing | B2B (business-to-nonprofit) | B2B (business-to-nonprofit) | B2B (business-to-nonprofit) |

#### Our Differentiation:
- **Consumer-focused**: Serves general public vs. nonprofit sector only
- **Flexible charity choice**: Donors select from any JustGiving charity
- **Fixed donation structure**: Clear, transparent pricing model
- **Multilingual platform**: 17 languages for global accessibility
- **Anonymous privacy model**: Protects donor identity while enabling recognition choice

### Core Values
- **Australian Legal Compliance**: Privacy Act, Consumer Law, ACNC requirements
- **Social Impact**: Connecting community needs with charitable giving
- **Privacy-First**: Anonymous public display with optional personal recognition
- **Donor-Centric**: Focus on charitable giving experience over transactional service delivery

## Business Details

- **Entity**: Individual/Sole Trader - MEHMET AKIF ALTUNDAL
- **ABN**: 17 927 784 658 (Active from 22/07/2025)
- **Email**: contact@poweredbydonation.com
- **Location**: NSW, Australia

## Technical Stack (ALWAYS USE THESE)
```
Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + next-intl
Backend: Supabase (database, auth, edge functions)
Deployment: GitHub → Vercel (automated deployment)
Package Manager: pnpm (NEVER use npm)
Internationalization: next-intl with 17 language support
```

## Core Architecture Principles

### Privacy Model: Anonymous + Aggregate + Optional Sharing
- **Always Anonymous**: No public donor names or persistent identities
- **Aggregate Statistics**: Platform activity shown in totals only
- **Optional Recognition**: Users choose when to get personal credit
- **Private Connections**: Donor names shared with providers & charities only

### Component Architecture
**Split by pain, not by rules.** Create new components when existing ones become difficult to work with, not because they hit arbitrary line limits.

#### Component Size Targets:
- **Pages**: 100-200 lines (orchestration)
- **Sections**: 50-100 lines (major UI areas)
- **Features**: 20-50 lines (business logic)
- **UI Components**: 10-30 lines (generic elements)

### Database: Unified User System
Single `users` table supporting both provider and supporter roles with happiness-based reputation metrics. See [README-database.md](./README-database.md) for complete schema details.

## Service Management & Quality System

### Mutual Happiness Feedback
Both providers and supporters rate each service interaction with simple happy/unhappy ratings. This creates:
- **Quality control** through happiness metrics and filtering
- **Service access requirements** based on reputation scores  
- **Balanced feedback** maintaining donor-centric approach

### Service Features
- **Fixed donation amounts** (e.g., exactly $50, not minimum or variable)
- **Charity requirements** ("any charity" or "specific charities")
- **Availability management** (date ranges and capacity limits)
- **Location flexibility** (physical, remote, or hybrid delivery)

## Charity & SEO System

### Charity Pages: Anonymous Impact Display
Charity pages at `/charity/[slug]` showcase service-driven donations with complete anonymity:
- **Anonymous activity**: "Someone donated $50 via Web Design service"
- **Aggregate statistics**: Total donations, monthly activity, service categories  
- **JustGiving integration**: Real charity data with SEO optimization

See [README-seo.md](./README-seo.md) for complete SEO strategy and implementation details.

## JustGiving Integration

### Donation Flow Implementation
The platform integrates with JustGiving's staging environment for secure charitable donations:

#### Core Components:
- **JustGiving Client** (`src/lib/justgiving/client.ts`): Handles API calls and URL generation
- **Donation Flow** (`src/components/services/ServiceDonationFlow.tsx`): User donation interface
- **Success Page** (`src/app/[locale]/donation-success/page.tsx`): Post-donation confirmation

#### URL Format:
```
https://link.staging.justgiving.com/v1/charity/donate/charityId/{id}?
donationValue={amount}&
currency=GBP&
exiturl={returnUrl}&
reference={serviceReference}&
skipGiftAid=true
```

#### Key Features:
- **Staging Environment**: Uses `link.staging.justgiving.com` for testing
- **Fixed Amounts**: Exact donation values, not minimums
- **Localized Returns**: Redirects to `/[locale]/donation-success` 
- **Donation Tracking**: JustGiving provides `jgDonationId` for confirmation
- **International Support**: `skipGiftAid=true` for non-UK donors

#### Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_JUSTGIVING_CHARITY_CHECKOUT_URL`: Override default staging URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Base URL for donation return redirects
- `JUSTGIVING_API_KEY`: API access for charity validation (defaults to staging key)

## User Experience & Internationalization

### Design Philosophy
- **Fixed layouts** - Consistent page structures for all entity types
- **Mobile-first** - Responsive design with accessibility focus
- **Simple privacy controls** - Basic show/hide toggles only
- **No customization** - Identical, optimized layouts for all users

### User Journeys
#### Anonymous Browsing
Browse services freely without signup - view pricing, charity requirements, provider info, and anonymous donation activity.

#### Provider Journey  
Sign up → Create services → Set fixed pricing → Choose charity requirements → Receive donations → Give/receive feedback

#### Supporter Journey
Browse services → View fixed pricing → Choose charity → Sign up → Donate via JustGiving → Confirmation page → Give feedback → Build reputation

### Internationalization: 17 Language Support
Complete translation coverage using next-intl with centralized language configuration in `src/config/languages.ts`.

#### Routing Patterns: Correct next-intl Implementation
There are NO routing consistency issues to fix. The codebase is using:
- **Server components**: `<a href="">` (correct)
- **Client components with same-locale navigation**: `<Link>` from next-intl (correct)
- **Client components with cross-locale navigation**: `<a href="">` (correct)

The routing is actually perfectly consistent and follows next-intl best practices. Different navigation patterns serve different purposes: same-locale navigation uses next-intl Link for SPA behavior, while cross-locale navigation uses anchor tags for proper internationalization context switching.

See [README-internationalization.md](./README-internationalization.md) for complete i18n implementation details.

## Development Information

### Brand Guidelines
- **Logo**: "PD" (text-based) or "Powered by Donation" (full name)
- **Typography**: System fonts only (no external dependencies)
- **Design**: Clean, fast-loading, accessibility-first, charitable aesthetic

### Development Environment
See [README-development.md](./README-development.md) for complete development setup, deployment workflows, and environment details.

## Essential Claude Guidelines
